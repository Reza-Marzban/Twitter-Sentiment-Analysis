# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Tensorflow platform and NLP techniques

For this twitter sentiment analysis, I used Deep learning architectures.
In specific, I created a 1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network and an Long Short Term Memory to compare the result.
I used Word2Vec Embedding representations of words.
